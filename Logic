Should I:

# Recreate the model I have. IGNORE
# Create new model so I don't have to put it back together from .pth and .json IGNORE


# figure out how to tell Grok what the structure for the parent model is. SOLVED
  ## Create new model using Lab 3
  ## Just tell it the .json
  
# Figure out what the student model architecture should be. DOING
  ## Make sure Grok knows block 1 does batch inference.
  ## Make sure Grok knows the starting inputs, expansion factor, kernal,  stride, padding, and output channel counts
  ## Get Grok to proudce one based on parent model

# Learn how to do knowledge distillation with a model that has batch inference to a smaller model. TODO
# Iterate
